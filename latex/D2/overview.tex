 There are two primary objectives of Deliverable 2. They are as follows.
 \begin{itemize}
    \item To review source code systematically against best practices and style guidelines that it claims to conform to.
    \item To test program P of Source Code S systematically using a list of test cases.
 \end{itemize}
